# Auto-Start-Video
A simple .bat script to copy a video to the windows startup folders.

## Installation
  - Copy all the `.bat` files to a folder.
  - Copy your video/image/script.

## Usage
### Add to autostart
  - Running the file `add.bat` will copy any file named 'video' (uses selector `video*`) to both the 'startup' and 'common startup' directories.
  - Running the file `remove.bat` will delete any file named 'video' (uses selector `video*`) inside the 'startup' and 'common startup' directories.
    - *Note: Unless the script is run as an administrator, the 'common startup' folder won't be affected.*

## License
